That is, just one booster for Earth to launch as opposed to two, so for Earth it will take on ~550 kg as required. I've used a low-cost version of Falcon Heavy to boost payload from orbit to orbit. |
|  8 | @Erdayastronaut Raptor V2.0 is a major improvement in simplication, while also increasing thrust from ~185 tons to ~230 tons.
